# MES Scalping Bot – Public Architecture Showcase

🚀 **Overview**

This repository showcases the architecture and design approach behind an automated trading bot focused on the Micro E-mini S&P 500 Futures (MES!). The project is engineered for high-frequency, intraday scalping with automation pipelines connecting chart signals to broker execution.

> ⚠️ This is a **technical case study repo**. The full strategy logic is maintained in a private repository as the system is being positioned for commercial use.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The trading automation system connects:

```plaintext
TradingView Alerts → Pipedream Webhook Middleware → Tradovate API → Execution Engine
🔧 Components:
TradingView (Pine Script v6): Custom indicators + alert triggers

Pipedream: Receives alerts, formats them, adds auth headers

Tradovate API: Sends trade orders to a demo or live account

📊 Strategy Approach
Scalping MES during US session

Indicators:

RSI for overbought/oversold detection

ATR for dynamic stop-loss

MAs for directional filtering

Risk Controls:

No overnight trades

No weekend trades

Hard stop-loss based on volatility

🧪 Demo Code
This repository includes simplified, non-functional code samples to demonstrate the pipeline:

Folder	Purpose
pine_scripts/	Sample Pine v6 indicator
pipedream/	Webhook payload template
tradovate_api/	Stubbed execution logic (Node.js)

📈 Future Vision
This automation stack is being expanded toward:

Multi-asset support (e.g., BTC, CL)

Risk-adaptive logic via ML

Collaboration opportunities in hedge fund structures or signal licensing
