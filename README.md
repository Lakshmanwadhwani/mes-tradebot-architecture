# MES Scalping Bot – Public Architecture Showcase

🚀 **Overview**

This repository showcases the architecture and design approach behind an automated trading bot focused on the Micro E-mini S&P 500 Futures (MES!). The project is engineered for high-frequency, intraday scalping with automation pipelines connecting chart signals to broker execution.
